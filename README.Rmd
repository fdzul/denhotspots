***denhotspots*** is package development by department of prevention and control of vector-borne diseases of the [Secretary of Health of Veracruz](https://www.ssaver.gob.mx/) with colaboration of the national dengue prevention and control program of the [CENAPRECE](https://www.gob.mx/salud/cenaprece) and entomology laboratory of [INDRE](https://www.gob.mx/salud/acciones-y-programas/instituto-de-diagnostico-y-referencia-epidemiologicos-indre)*

The goal of ***denhotspots*** is to 




## Installation

You can install the development version of denhotspots from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fdzul/denhotspots")
```
or

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("fdzul/denhotspots")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(denhotspots)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
