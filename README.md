**denhotspots is a package developed in the department of prevention and control of diseases transmitted by vector of the [Secretary of Health of Veracruz](https://www.ssaver.gob.mx/) and with colaboration of the federal level**


## **overview**

**denhotspots** is a package to generate predictive maps of the number of eggs or adults in areas where it is not collected.The predictive maps are generated using geostatistical analysis in the [INLA](http://www.r-inla.org/) framework. 

  - **`gihi()`** generate the predictive map.
  - **`bivariate_map()`** generates an entomological risk map or an egg density map.
  - **`subset_den()`** It is a complementary function that helps in the creation of grid of the locality in the prediction stack in [INLA](http://www.r-inla.org/).
  - **`data_geocoden()`** It is a complementary function that helps in the creation of mesh.
  - **`geocoden()`** It is a complementary function that helps in the creation of mesh.
  - **`save_geocoden()`** It is a complementary function that helps in the creation of mesh.
  - **`point_to_polygons()`** It is a complementary function that helps in the creation of mesh.
